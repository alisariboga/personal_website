        <h1>Hello, I'm Ali</h1>
        <p>
            I moved to the UK in 2019 and have been working in the tech industry ever since. With a background in
            software development, my primary focus has been on web technologies.

            My journey into tech began with a strong interest in programming, which led me to explore various roles
            within the field. I’ve gained hands-on experience in backend development, quality assurance, and frontend
            development — and I particularly enjoy the challenge of building efficient, user-friendly applications.

            Currently based in London, I’m actively seeking new opportunities to grow my career in web development. I’m
            especially interested in roles that involve modern technologies and innovative projects where I can make a
            meaningful contribution.

            Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or check out my work on GitHub to learn more about my projects.

            Outside of work, I love experimenting with new technologies, contributing to open-source initiatives, and
            keeping up with the latest trends in web development.

            My goal is to continue evolving as a developer and to have a positive impact within the tech community. I’m
            passionate about creating applications that not only solve real-world problems but also deliver great user
            experiences.

            Thanks for visiting my personal site — I look forward to connecting with like-minded people and exploring
            exciting opportunities in the world of web development.</p>
