        <h1>Why Web Development?</h1>
        <p>
            Web development has always fascinated me. The ability to create interactive and dynamic websites that can
            reach a global audience is incredibly powerful. I love the challenge of solving problems and building
            something that people can use and enjoy.

            In the past, I gained experience in both Backend and QA roles. Over time, I began exploring different areas
            of software development and found myself especially drawn to web development. I really enjoy the instant
            feedback you get when working on the front end â€” seeing the results of your code immediately is both
            motivating and rewarding.
